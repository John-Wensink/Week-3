# Week-3
Here are the things I've been working on this week. You can jump into the Critical Thinking.py program for the the assigned program without additional features.
Definately check out the Better_Alarm and Better_Meal programs, I added some interesting functionality
Kind of a side project, I started working on a NCAA Mens Basketball tournament simulator, this was interestingg in using arrays to incorporate a (relatively) large data set
